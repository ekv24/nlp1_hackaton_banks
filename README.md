# nlp1_hackaton_banks
_Hackaton, supervised learning, binary classification and clustering_

### Description

In this competition our team create an alghoritm, which can classify bank reviews and clusterize them by meanings. 

We created a lot of features. For example: number of exclamation marks, answer signs, presence of phone number in review, names of banks, length of review, presence of date, number of caps symbols.

Analyzed the mood of reviews: we have made local bags of bad/good words, feature - difference between count of close and open brackets. Also, we have used library "nltk" to analyze the mood of review.

On these features we have trained the algorithm RandomForest and received predictions.
